# 36c3 Workshops
This repository contains material for my two **36c3 workshops**:

* [Python Programming for Absolute Beginners](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2019/wiki/index.php/Session:Python_Programming_for_Absolute_Beginner)
* [Introduction to Natural Language Processing](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2019/wiki/index.php/Session:Introduction_to_Natural_Language_Processing)

The *Juypter Notebooks* can be run/used interactively via [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/IngoKl/36c3-workshops/master).

## Running Locally
If you have [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com), you can simply run the following three commands in order to get started:

`conda env create -f environment.yml`
`conda activate 36c3`
`jupyter notebook`

*This will create a new conda (Python) environment called **36c3**.*
